# Leka's Style Guides

## About

> Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.
> 
> "*Style*" covers a lot of ground, from "*use camelCase for variable names*" to "*never use global variables*" to "*never use exceptions*". 

This project contains all the style guides we use at Leka to write code and/or documentation.
